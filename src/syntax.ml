(** Syntax of the language : definition of ADT, EVT, types and Environment 
 *
 *  Design choices:
 *	- there is not a construct for representing functions, 
 *	  there's instead a construct for declaring functions;
 *  	that is: I can declare and call functions, but there's not anonymous function.
 *	  this allows however to declare recursive function without using a dedicated construct.
 *  - The language requires type annotation for function parameter and return type
 *  - The construct Proj t i takes a tuple and an integer literal ! 
 *    That's the only way to perform a type analysis without define complex analyses.

(** 
	An environment is a map from identifier to "something".
	In the semantics this something is a value (what the identifier is bound to).
	In the type system this "something" is a type.
  In CFA this something is a label.
	For simplicity we represent the environment as an association list, i.e., a list of pair (identifier, data).
 *)
type 'v env = (string * 'v) list

(**
  Given an environment {env} and an identifier {x} it returns the data {x} is bound to.
  If there is no binding, it raises an exception.
*)
let rec lookup env x =
  match env with
  | []        -> raise(Exceptions.Binding_Error(x ^ " not found"))
  | (y, v)::r -> if x=y then v else lookup r x
